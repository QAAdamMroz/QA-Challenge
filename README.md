# QA-Challenge

Hello, you did not describe from which of side site should be automated, so i prepared two solution (for frontend and backend) with small report solution. 
Probably you will need to add external libraries that are outside the "QA Challenge" folder.
Enjoy the code and probably see you soon :) 
BTW. There is some tricky way to to bend the rules by front side we can use querry param for display all selected cars and the same in backend side change body param
